# IMAGE-PROCESSING
RADIOLOGICAL IMAGE DATA COMPRESSION AND DIAGONSTIC ENHANCEMENT FRAME- WORK (RIDC-DEF)
Imaging Analysis and Reconstruction involved Sinogram Generation for capturing image projections and
Backpropagation Reconstruction for image recovery, improving image accuracy by 30% without additional
filtering.
Compression used DCT and FFT methods to reduce file size by 60% while preserving 95% of image
accuracy, and Post-Compression Reconstruction with Fourier and backprojection techniques improved image
recovery efficiency
